# ðŸ’Š Medication Safety and Adverse Drug Events in Older Adults

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying high-risk medications and patterns of adverse drug events (ADEs) among older adults (65+). It aims to provide actionable insights that healthcare providers, policy makers, and researchers can use to reduce preventable hospitalizations, improve medication safety, and optimize patient outcomes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that:
- Ingests real-world adverse drug event data from the FDA Open Data API
- Transforms and models the data into a star-schema format
- Enables analytical queries and dashboards focused on medication safety in elderly populations

The final output helps stakeholders answer critical questions about drug-related risks in aging populations.
